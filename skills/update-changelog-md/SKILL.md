# update-changelog-md

Add a new version entry to `CHANGELOG.md`, or restructure the entire file, following
the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Workflow — new version entry

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` to identify the **last released version** and its date.
2. Run `git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD` to list all commits since that tag.
   If no tag exists for the last version, use `git log --oneline` and filter
   manually.
3. Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` to get today's release date — never hardcode it.
4. Determine the new version number (ask the user if not specified):
   - **MAJOR** bump: breaking changes or major redesign.
   - **MINOR** bump: new features, backward-compatible.
   - **PATCH** bump: bug fixes only.
5. Group commits into Keep a Changelog sections (see **Section rules** below).
6. Prepend the new version block immediately after the file header (before the
   previous latest version).
7. Do NOT remove or alter any existing version entries.

## Workflow — restructure entire CHANGELOG.md

1. Read the full `CHANGELOG.md` and note all existing version blocks.
2. Rewrite the file preserving all versions and dates but enforcing:
   - Correct header and intro paragraph (see **File header** below).
   - Consistent section names and ordering.
   - Bullet style: start each item with a capital letter, no trailing period.
3. Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` and confirm the latest version date is still accurate.

## File header

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
```

## Version block format

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

- ...

### Changed

- ...

### Fixed

- ...
```

Omit any section that has no entries. Do not add empty sections.

## Section rules

Use **only** these standard Keep a Changelog section names, in this order when
multiple sections are present:

| Section      | When to use                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `Added`      | New features or capabilities           |
| `Changed`    | Changes to existing behavior           |
| `Deprecated` | Features marked for future removal     |
| `Removed`    | Features removed in this release       |
| `Fixed`      | Bug fixes                              |
| `Security`   | Security-related fixes or improvements |

## Commit → section mapping heuristics

- `feat:` / `add` / `new` → **Added**
- `refactor:` / `change` / `rename` / `move` / `update` / `improve` → **Changed**
- `fix:` / `bug` / `patch` → **Fixed**
- `remove:` / `delete` / `drop` → **Removed**
- `deprecate:` → **Deprecated**
- `security:` / `cve` / `vuln` → **Security**
- `docs:` / `chore:` / `ci:` / `test:` — omit unless user-facing.

When a commit message is ambiguous, infer intent from the diff or file name.

## Style rules

- Write **in English** throughout.
- Each bullet: capital letter, present tense, no trailing period.
  Example: `Add retry logic for HTTP requests`
- Keep bullets concise — one line per entry where possible.
- Wrap code identifiers, file paths, and module names in backticks.
- Never guess dates — always use `date +%Y-%m-%d`.
